Build and compile
Build code:

$ git clone git@github.com:sipeed/MaixPy.git #Download sdk
$ cd port/k210-standalon/ #Enter the platform code directory
$ make build #build platform code in case of first use
Compile the code:

$ make CROSS_COMPILE=/your_compiler_path/bin/riscv64-unknown-elf-
We recommend using compiler version 7.2.0

your_compiler_path is the compiler path, about the compiler , you can see http://dan.lichee.pro/

After compiling, the micropython.bin file will be generated in this directory, and you can burne it to the Sipeed Maix One suite.

The burning method can be found at http://dan.lichee.pro/
