The quantities will usually be rounded to what you can usually purchase from ebay -
meaning if you need 8 of something, I'll say 10, if you need 78 of something , I'll say 100. if you need 5 but the smallest quantity I could find online is 25 I will put 5 (25).
 In most cases the minimum quantity costs $1 to $4 including shipping.
Again, check the parts link in step 15.

* ATMega32TQFP Microcontroller - 1
* 40 pin shrouded male cable header connectors - 4 (10) NOT SMT
* 10 pin shrouded male cable header connector -  1 (10)NOT SMT
* 74HC574DWR flip-flop / latch (LED Driver)- 8 (10)
* 74HC138DR demultiplexer - 1 (1-2)
* FZT851 SOT23 Transistor - 8 (10)

*****40 conductor******* 40 pin cable with female connectors - 2
I cannot stress enough that it must be 40 conductor (OLD CD-ROM IDE / hard disk cables).
If ordering hard disk / CD-ROM cables, they must be ATA33.
NOT ATA 66, 100 and 133 cables - these are all 80 conductor 40 pin cables. These do not connect all 40 pins, and therefore don't work.
Most ebay vendors advertising ATA33 cables ship 80 conductor !
If you can't find pre-made cables, get a length of 40 conductor ribbon cable and 40 pin female cable crimp connectors.
You can use solder type connectors, but crimps are so much neater. You'll need a vise or clamp to crimp the connectors to the cable.
Worst case scenario, solder the cable from the board to the cube.

CURRENTLY the vendor on the parts page has actual 40 conductor cables.

* USBTiny, USBasp or other ICSP Programmer - 1 
* USB TTL Serial adapter - 1 (optional - only for PC assisted operation)
** 5V to 7.5V power adapter - 1 (minimum 500mA) Set power input jumper accordingly.
