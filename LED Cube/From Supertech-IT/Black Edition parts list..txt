The 3.5X hybrid boards and above take SMT OR discrete components. Choose one or the other for each part, you don't need both.
The parts list applies to the 3.4A, 3.5A, 3.5D, and 3.7A black edition boards.

**************************************************

The quantities will usually be rounded to what you can usually purchase from ebay -
meaning if you need 8 of something, I'll say 10, if you need 78 of something , I'll say 100. if you need 5 but the smallest quantity I could find online is 25 I will put 5 (25).
 In most cases the minimum quantity costs $1 to $4 including shipping.
Again, check the parts link in step 15.
Triple asterisk *** denotes an OPTION for boards like the 3.5A which can take through hole OR surface mount components. the *** will precede the surface mount equivalent of the previously listed part.

* 40 pin shrouded male cable header connectors - 4 (10) OR
** 2 male, and 2 female if you intend to connect your board directly to the bottom or top of one of my base boards**.
* 10 pin shrouded male cable header connector -  1 (10)
* 74HC574 flip-flop / latch (LED Driver)- 8 (10)
* 74HC138 demultiplexer - 1 (1-2)
* 2N2222 transistor - 10
*** MMBT2222 Sot-23 - 10 (100)
* Single row straight header strip - 1 (20 - 40 pins)
* 1117-5 5V SMT 5V regulator - 1 (10)
* 1117-3 3.3V SMT 5V regulator - 1 (10) [3.5D only]
* 16MHz HC-49S 2 pin crystal oscillator - 1
* TC-0103 6.2x6.2x4.2 mm Tact Tactile Push Button Momentary SMD PCB Switch - 3 (50) *** you need 4 for the 3.5x series
NOTE - these buttons are not available from our "cheap" supplier anymore. The 3.7X boards take the new buttons in the current price links page in the instructable in step 15.
* 22pF ceramic capacitors - 2 (30) *** optional SMT size 0805 
* 0.1 uF (100 nF) ceramic capacitors - 4 (50) *** optional SMT size 0805
* 100uF electrolytic capacitor - 1 (20)
* Assorted colour LEDs - 4 (30) *** 6 for 3.5A
* DC Power Supply Female Jack Socket 5.5 x 2.1mm Barrel-Type 1 (2)
* pack of assorted IC sockets (must contain 40 pin and narrow 28 pin) - 1 pack
* 20 pin IC sockets - 8 (10)
* 100 to 220 ohm resistors - 100 (I use 100 or 120 ohm) *** optional SMT size 0603
* 5K resistors - 9 (50) *** optional SMT

*****40 conductor******* 40 pin cable with female connectors - 2
I cannot stress enough that it must be 40 conductor (OLD CD-ROM IDE / hard disk cables).
If ordering hard disk cables, they must be ATA33.
NOT ATA 66, 100 and 133 cables - these are all 80 conductor 40 pin cables. These do not connect all 40 pins, and therefore don't work.
Most ebay vendors advertising ATA33 cables ship 80 conductor !
If you can't find pre-made cables, get a length of 40 conductor ribbon cable and 40 pin female cable crimp connectors.
You can use solder type connectors, but crimps are so much neater. You'll need a vise or clamp to crimp the connectors to the cable.
Worst case scenario, solder the cable from the board to the cube.

CURRENTLY the vendor on the parts page has actual 40 conductor cables.

OPTIONALLY - you can use 40 pin female and 40 pin male connectors to connect the black edition board directly to the cube base !
I find this works best! 

****************************************************************************

OPTIONAL:
** USBTiny, USBasp or other ICSP Programmer - 1 (needed if you are using the 32A/L microcontroller or if you don't have an Arduino to program the 328P)
** USB TTL Serial adapter - 1 (only for non-standalone operation)
** 5V to 7.5V power adapter - 1 (minimum 500mA) Set power input jumper accordingly.

** One or both of ATmega32A/L and ATmega328P microcontrollers - only one used at a time

** Arduino Uno board (not needed if you have an ICSP)
